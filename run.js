// This is a very limited and crude implementation of a task that processes emails from a mailbox. This was made in a hurry as a temporary solution
// and probably has a lot o bugs and issues that were not exposed in our specific use case. Feel free to use this at your own peril. Be very, very
// prudent in your testing to ensure this works as expected in your specific use case. According to general best practices this should be rewritten
// to be more robust and reliable. On that bases you could argue this is not a production ready solution. Again, use at your own risk. 
//
// This is the main entry point if the application is scheduled as a webjob on an Azure App Service.
